Add tracked subsessions (beta, off by default): agents can spawn child sessions they stay attached to. The new `spawn_subsession` tool starts a child session linked to its parent (recorded in the session tree), notifies the parent when the child stops working, and lets the parent inspect children via `list_subsessions` and `read_subsession`. The completion notice is delivered as a system-authored message (not attributed to the human), and still wakes an idle parent while queueing behind any in-flight work. Unlike the fire-and-forget `spawn_session`, subsessions are observable by their spawner.

The capability is gated behind a beta flag so it can ship without being exposed in releases: enable it with the `PI_WEB_SUBSESSIONS` env var, the `subsessions` config key, or the "Allow agents to start tracked subsessions" toggle in Settings → Session daemon. It also requires `spawnSessions` to be enabled. Requires a manual session daemon restart to take effect.
